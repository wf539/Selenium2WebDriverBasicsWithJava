Description
"Selenium 2: WebDriver Basics in Java" is a hands on training course designed to teach the basics of the WebDriver API using Java.

The course is designed to build simply, and learn by doing, with continual elaboration of the API.

For each section we briefly discuss the theory, showing code examples to put it into context, then we do some hands on work followed by a discussion of the exercises and code reviews of worked examples.

We have chunked the API into Navigation, Interrogation, Manipulation and Synchronisation. As this helps lead the student through the basics of the API. Then we cover specific parts of the API which build on these e.g. JavaScript etc.

While the course is not designed to teach Java, only a basic level of Java is used and the principles of the code are explained as we go. This course is not suitable for people who have not programmed before, but people who have programmed in other languages should adapt quickly.

Tests are run from the IDE, and we use maven so that the final tests are suitable for execution from continuous integration
